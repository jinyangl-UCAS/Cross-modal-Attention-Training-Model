# Cross-modal-Attention-Training-Model
A computational model for cross-modal attention training running on MATLAB.

## Description
The model is for my undergraduate thesis. This is the abstract of my thesis:

> Cross-modal attention switching training is a training that requires subjects to switch their attention continuously between tasks that locate in different modals. As this training requires cooperation within multiple sensory regions, the training effect may have an overall improvement on attention. Since there is still little research on cross-modal attention switching training, to explore the factors that may contribute to the improvement of the training can help the design of the paradigm. On the basis of previous work, this thesis built a perception-decision model with three variable cognitive factors, including cross-modal attention, cross-modal integration inhibition and decision sensitivity, to simulate the activity of neural circuits in cross-modal and unimodal attention switching tasks. Simulated results showed that the correctness in cross-modal tasks was improved when each of the three cognitive factors was enhanced, suggesting they are all potential reasons when improvement in cross-modal attention training is observed. Moreover, they had a collaborative effect on the improvement. The correctness in unimodal tasks was also improved when cross-modal attention or decision sensitivity was enhanced. This means if cross-modal attention or decision sensitivity is the reason behind the improvement in cross-modal training, the training effect can be transferred to unimodal tasks. This thesis can help the design of cross-modal training paradigm as well as the analysis of the results.

Part of the model was based on the work by Jain (2008), where he built a model to simulate the effect of cross-modal interaction. As the task he used is similar to a paradigm in cross-modal training, I used the framework as well as the formula in his work as a foundation of my model. See the work by Jain (2008):
